Supercharge your FastAPI development in the [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev/) with this collection of production-ready code snippets. From bootstrapping your app to deploying advanced features, these snippets are designed to follow modern best practices and save you time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern Syntax**: Uses modern Python features like `Annotated` for clear, type-safe code.
- **Comprehensive**: Covers everything from basic app setup to advanced topics like WebSockets, caching, and background tasks.
- **Pydantic v2 Ready**: Snippets are designed to work with the latest Pydantic features.
- **Asynchronous by Default**: Prioritizes `async` patterns for high-performance applications.
- **Well-Documented**: Each snippet comes with a clear description of what it does and how to use it.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è New in this Version

This version introduces powerful new snippets and modernizes existing ones for a better development experience.

- **`fastsettings`**: Manage your application's configuration effortlessly using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`.
- **`fastcrud`**: A generic, reusable router for basic Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with SQLAlchemy.
- **`faststream`**: Implement streaming responses for large data or video feeds.
- **Modernized Snippets**: All existing snippets have been updated to use the latest FastAPI and Pydantic best practices, including `Annotated` type hints and Pydantic v2 `model_config`.

### Example: `fastsettings`
Quickly define and load configuration from environment variables:
```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_name: str = "Awesome API"
    database_url: str
    secret_key: str

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")

settings = Settings()
```

### Example: `fastcrud`
Generate a full set of CRUD endpoints for a SQLAlchemy model with a single function:
```python
# In your router file
from . import models, schemas
from .database import get_db

# Create the router
crud_router = create_crud_router(
    prefix="/users",
    tags=["Users"],
    db_session=get_db,
    db_model=models.User,
    schema_read=schemas.UserRead,
    schema_create=schemas.UserCreate,
    schema_update=schemas.UserUpdate,
)

app.include_router(crud_router)
```
